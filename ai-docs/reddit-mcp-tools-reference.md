# Reddit MCP Server - Complete Tools Reference

**Server Name:** Reddit MCP  
**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Transport:** STDIO  
**Architecture:** Three-Layer Architecture for Comprehensive Reddit Research  

---

## üèóÔ∏è Three-Layer Architecture (Recommended Approach)

The Reddit MCP server implements a sophisticated three-layer architecture designed for comprehensive research workflows:

### Layer 1: Discovery
**Always start your research here!**

#### `discover_reddit_resources()`
**Primary entry point for all Reddit research**

**Description:** Discovers 8-15 relevant communities using multiple search strategies and provides recommended workflows.

**Parameters:**
- `topic` (Optional[str]): Topic to find relevant communities for
- `include_communities` (bool, default: True): Whether to search for relevant subreddits  
- `discovery_depth` (str, default: "comprehensive"): Discovery thoroughness
  - `"quick"`: Single search (faster, 3-5 subreddits)
  - `"comprehensive"`: Multiple searches (8-15 subreddits for broader perspective)

**Returns:**
- Available operations with descriptions
- Relevant communities discovered for the topic
- Recommended workflow for comprehensive coverage
- Suggested parameters for next steps

**Example Usage:**
```python
discover_reddit_resources(
    topic="artificial intelligence ethics", 
    discovery_depth="comprehensive"
)
```

---

### Layer 2: Requirements
**Use this before executing operations**

#### `get_operation_requirements()`
**Get detailed requirements and guidance for Reddit operations**

**Description:** Provides parameter schemas, validation rules, context-aware suggestions, and common mistakes to avoid.

**Parameters:**
- `operation_id` (str): The operation ID from discover_reddit_resources
- `context` (Optional[str]): Context about what you're trying to accomplish

**Returns:**
- Detailed parameter schemas
- Validation rules and constraints
- Context-aware suggestions
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Next step recommendations

**Example Usage:**
```python
get_operation_requirements(
    "fetch_multiple",
    context="researching AI impact on job market"
)
```

---

### Layer 3: Execution
**Execute operations with validated parameters**

#### `execute_reddit_operation()`
**Unified execution tool for all Reddit operations**

**Description:** Validates parameters and executes Reddit operations with comprehensive error handling.

**Parameters:**
- `operation_id` (str): The operation to execute (from Layer 1)
- `parameters` (Dict[str, Any]): Parameters matching the schema from Layer 2
- `validate` (bool, default: True): Whether to validate parameters before execution

**Returns:**
- Operation results or detailed error information
- Clean parameter summary
- Success/failure status with actionable hints

**Available Operation IDs:**
- `"search_all"` - Search across all of Reddit
- `"search_subreddit"` - Search within specific subreddit  
- `"fetch_posts"` - Get latest posts from subreddit
- `"fetch_multiple"` - ‚ö° Batch fetch from multiple subreddits (MOST EFFICIENT)
- `"fetch_comments"` - Get post with full discussion tree

**Example Usage:**
```python
execute_reddit_operation("fetch_multiple", {
    "subreddit_names": ["MachineLearning", "artificial", "Futurology"],
    "listing_type": "hot",
    "limit_per_subreddit": 8
})
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Direct Tools (Legacy Support)

These tools can be used directly but the three-layer architecture is recommended for better results.

### Search Tools

#### `search_posts_tool()`
**Search across all of Reddit**

- `time_filter` (str, default: "all"): ["all", "year", "month", "week", "day"]
- `limit` (int, default: 10): Number of results (1-100)

**Tips:**
- Use quotes for exact phrases: `"specific phrase"`
- Combine related terms with spaces
- Reddit search uses boolean AND by default

---

#### `search_in_subreddit_tool()`
**Search within a specific subreddit community**

**Parameters:**
- `subreddit_name` (str, required): Name without 'r/' prefix (e.g., "Python", "AskReddit")
- `query` (str, required): Search terms for within that subreddit (2-512 chars)

- `listing_type` (str, default: "hot"): ["hot", "new", "top", "rising"]
- `time_filter` (str, optional): ["all", "year", "month", "week", "day"] (only for "top")
- `limit_per_subreddit` (int, default: 5): Posts per subreddit (1-25)

**Performance Benefits:**
- 70% fewer API calls vs individual fetches
- ~40% token reduction
- 3x faster execution

    "query": "your refined search terms",
    "time_filter": "year",
    "limit": 20
})
```

### 5. Deep Analysis Phase
```python
# CRITICAL: Fetch detailed comments for AT LEAST 10 posts
